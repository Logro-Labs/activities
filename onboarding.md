# Checklist: Definition of Done

- Communicate with client to make sure she received the invoice.
- Move opportunity in Logro to “Onboarding” or whatever stage we have to show that the client is signed, paid and ready to go.
- Create sub-account in OctoCRM for the client.
- Add a user for the client and set permissions according to what they should be able to do based on the agreement. We can always enable things later. This is how I did it for Sandra. (Image of permissions)
- Communicate with the client to confirm she received CRM login. Explain that it's for later and we will walk her through using it.
- Create a folder for client in logro shared drive.
- Create slack channel for client and add folder link as bookmark URL.
- Create a click up list for client and add link to the client slack channel as a bookmark.
- Make a list of high level objectives for the next 12-24 months.
- Does this client already have a strategy?
- Create a document that will represent our formula and 12 month timeline. Call it “Sandra Blunkall Marketing Formula”.
- Schedule weekly recurring meetings with clients (confirm via email). Called “Sandra Blunkall + Logro - Marketing Debrief”. Make sure the first meeting gives us enough time to analyze the current state and build the formula doc before.
- Create a folder inside the client folder called “Sandra’s Files” and share that folder with the client. This is where she can upload files for us and we can add documents that need to be shared with her. Those documents should be attached to corresponding click up cards.
- Present formula doc during first debrief meeting. A PDF version of the formula should be named with the date and dropped in the client’s files folder so they have access.
- Create a new collection in BitWarden for client (using client’s name) in the Logro organization. This is where we will store all login information when it is given to us.
